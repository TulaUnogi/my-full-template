# My very first website

Welcome to my very first website! 

It has been created thanks to [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) as a part of my coding lessons and challenges.

For this project I used HTML5 and CSS3 as a coding languages. 
I also used Google and Wikipedia as the sources of links and images contained.
The purpose of the website is to present the resources I am going to be working with during my next three upcoming milestone projects.
The website includes navigation bar as well as working links to the websites providing informations about the listed companies.

Enjoy!
